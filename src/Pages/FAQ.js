           <p>
           What do I do if I have forgotten my PIN? Simply click here, enter a few quick details and your PIN will be emailed to you.
What do I do if my PIN does not work? If your PIN does not work and you are at the gym during staffed hours, simply ring the buzzer near the entrance portals and a member of staff will be out to support you. If you are not at the gym during staffed hours, you can contact us.
Can I let others use my PIN? No, this will result in the termination of your membership. Even if you are sharing your PIN with someone who has their own paid membership, both memberships will be terminated.
I’ve signed up to a gym that hasn’t opened yet, can I still use my membership? Unfortunately not until your home gym is open, your membership will not be active, even if you are a Ultimate member. Alternatively, you can join one of our other locations instead, and change your home gym at a later date.
Can I change my membership type between any of the following: Ultimate, Standard or Off-Peak? Yes you can change your membership product to any of our Off-Peak, Standard or Ultimate memberships from these products. I.e. Off-Peak to Ultimate membership is available via the Member Area.
Can I change my membership between Do It and Live It? You can change from a Live It to Do It membership and change from Do It to Live It via the Member Area.
Can I change to a fixed-term membership, i.e. Students or Ultimate? You cannot change your membership directly to our fixed-term memberships if you pay monthly. If you would like to benefit from a fixed-term membership, you will need to cancel your existing membership and re-join.
Can I change my home gym? Yes, you can change your home gym in the Member Area for a £5 admin fee. Please note, your payment may be higher than £5 if you are moving to a more expensive gym as this includes a pro-rata payment to cover the remainder of the month. Please note that you will be unable to make these changes if your membership is frozen.

There will be extra terms for our Ultimate, Standard and Off-Peak monthly members. On this membership type you can change your gym to any of our gyms with the same membership type. It is not possible to change your gym outside of the clubs that offer Ultimate, Standard and Off-Peak memberships.
Can I add Yanga Sports water to my membership? Yanga Sports Water is a great way to stay hydrated during your workouts. You can add this service for an additional £4 per month via the online Member Area if you have a monthly membership. Have your 500ml bottle and PIN code at the ready, then find the machine in your gym. You will need to wait 20 minutes before your next refill.
How do I book a class? You can book classes via the Member Area or our mobile app
How do I book a session with a PT? You can book a session with one of our expert personal trainers by contacting them via the Member Area or our mobile app
Can I restart my old membership? Yes, you can re-join here. Please note, you will still need to pay a joining fee if you are a returning member.
